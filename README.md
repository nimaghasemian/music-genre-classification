# Music Genre Classification with CNN


A deep learning application that classifies music into 10 different genres using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features.

## Features

- üéµ Classifies music into 10 genres: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Rock
- üéß Supports both file upload and sample audio files
- üìä Built with TensorFlow/Keras for the CNN model
- üñ•Ô∏è Streamlit-based user interface
- ‚ö° Fast prediction with pre-trained model

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nimaghasemian/Music-Genre-Classification.git
    cd Music-Genre-Classification
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**

   It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv music_venv
   source music_venv/bin/activate  # Windows: music_venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
